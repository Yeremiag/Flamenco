# Flamenco
A Python program that lets you play Minecraft using a guitar. This program converts sound frequency into the game. Every string you strum sends a command straight into the game. Each note triggers a different in-game action.

How to use:
1. Grab your guitar. (you could use other instruments as well, just convert the guitar note to other instruments)
2. Open the Controls.png image.
3. Open the Flamenco.py file in Visual Studio Code and run it (Don't forget to install the libraries).
4. Have fun!
